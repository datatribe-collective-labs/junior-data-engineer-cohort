### Capstone Project (Optional)

**Ingest â†’ Transform with BigQuery â†’ Visualize with Streamlit â†’ Orchestrate with Cloud Composer/Airflow**

- Create a Dashboard in Streamlit to visualize the data
- Step 1: Ingest data from a public APIs or datasets from [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/projects/datasets.md)
- Step 2: Identify a business case to showcase a trend or pattern based on the chosen dataset
- Step 3: Transform the data using Pandas/Pyspark
- Step 4: Store the data in BigQuery database
- Step 5: Create a dashboard using Streamlit to visualize the data
- Step 6: Create a repository on GitHub and leverage poetry build tool
- Additional Step: Orchestrate this project in CLoud Composer or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/operators/cloud/bigquery.html)
