## Week 5: Orchestration, Visualization, and Capstone

**🎯 Goal:** Build workflows and share results.

- [Airflow](https://github.com/sunjana2199/amazon_books_data_pipeline/tree/main)
- [Visualize with Streamlit – DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/streamlit)
- [DuckDB](https://motherduck.com/blog/duckdb-tutorial-for-beginners/)

### Google Cloud Skills Boost

- [Orchestrating Data Pipelines with Cloud Composer](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/69)

### Capstone Project (Optional)

**Ingest → Transform with BigQuery → Visualize with Streamlit → Orchestrate with Cloud Composer/Airflow**

- Create a Dashboard in Streamlit to visualize the data
- Step 1: Ingest data from a public APIs or datasets from [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/projects/datasets.md)
- Step 2: Identify a business case to showcase a trend or pattern based on the chosen dataset
- Step 3: Transform the data using Pandas/Pyspark
- Step 4: Store the data in BigQuery database
- Step 5: Create a dashboard using Streamlit to visualize the data
- Step 6: Create a repository on GitHub and leverage poetry build tool
- Additional Step: Orchestrate this project in CLoud Composer or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/operators/cloud/bigquery.html)
